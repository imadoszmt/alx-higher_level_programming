This project explores fundamental Python data structures and functions. It covers sets, their common methods, and appropriate use cases compared to lists, along with iteration techniques. The repository also delves into dictionaries, explaining their structure, keys, and when to prefer them over lists or sets. Additionally, it introduces lambda functions and the powerful map, reduce, and filter functions. Each concept is thoroughly explained with practical examples, making this resource ideal for Python beginners and those looking to reinforce their understanding of these essential programming concepts.
