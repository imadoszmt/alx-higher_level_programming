The tasks of this project we will learn how to import and use functions from other files, create and utilize modules, and prevent code execution when scripts are imported. Additionally, we will see how to use the built-in dir() function for inspecting objects and how to handle command line arguments in our Python programs. These topics will help us write more modular, reusable, and efficient code.
