This repo is about handling and using **Exceptions** and how to distinguish them compared to **Errors**:

##Errors vs. Exceptions:

Errors stem from the environment, while exceptions arise within the program. Errors are fatal, exceptions can be managed.

##Understanding Exceptions:

Exceptions disrupt normal program flow. Use try-except blocks to handle them gracefully.

##Using Exceptions:

Apply exceptions for handling disruptions like input validation.

##Handling Exceptions:

Catch specific exceptions, provide clear error messages, and take appropriate actions to recover.

##Purpose of Exception Handling:

Catching exceptions prevents crashes, maintains program stability, and informs users of errors.

##Raising Built-in Exceptions:

Use raise with the exception type and an optional message, e.g., raise ValueError("Invalid input").

##Implementing Clean-up Actions:

Use finally blocks for clean-up tasks like closing files or releasing resources post-exception.
